# PasscrackerProject
This is a project I did in my free time. I will try to improve it with time.
Since this project tries to find the password randomly it might take a lot of time (or not it's just a gamble :D).
Program uses around 500 MB ram if it is less then that it's probably okay but if it is around 800 MB there might be a problem.
Bruteforce one is obviously just tries to find the password trying every single(almost) password.
